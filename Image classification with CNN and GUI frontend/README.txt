Instructions:

*open the folder in vs code so that the CNN model file named " image_classifier.h5"Â  can be used in the GUI code*
To run the program open the GUI.py file and run it, then you can feed sample images into the GUI and get back predictions.
In the CNN file you can run the code to see the model training and all the summaries, i have already included a saved CNN model called "image_classifier.h5" that the GUI file uses to predict input images.
If you want to print the accuracy and loss graphs you can uncomment the CNN.py code at the bottom.
I have also included sample agumented images to test with.
