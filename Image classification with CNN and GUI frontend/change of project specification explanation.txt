This is a note to explain the change of my project specifications.
While trying to understand the object detection problem using Yolo i realized that it is alot of work that wasnt taught in this course or my other AI course, thus after asking 
other students what they were doing and seeing that their project were more simple than mine, i decided to change my project by only doing Image classification and not continuing to the detection. To make up for the reducition in complexity i did alot of reaserch into making the CNN accurate towards auguments such as rotations and translations by using different techniques when building and training the CNN. I also added a simple GUI frontend that you can input images to and get back results.
